## maleo + WebKit2 

## build

You need libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev, libseed (from git) with patch to use libwebkit2gtk-4.0 and javascriptcoregtk-4.0.

The extension is still a bare `Makefile` inside the src directory, I'll update it as soon as I really put my faith into this `seed`-way instead of custom node-like `JavaScriptCore`-way.
